We will use the 100K MovieLens dataset available at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/ to estimate unknown user ratings given their previous ratings through various PCA techniques. The whole Notebook https://github.com/ConnorJamesRice/Movie-Recommendations-/blob/main/matrix_completion_and_recommendation_systems_started_code_(1).ipynb has what was preformed for calculations and explanations.
